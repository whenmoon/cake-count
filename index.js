// Codeworks students like to bake cakes. They already have some recipes and ingredients in the kitchen. 
// How many cakes can they bake, given what's available? 

// Write a function cakes(), which takes two objects as arguments: the recipe, and the available ingredients. 
// The function returns the maximum number of cakes they can bake as an integer.

// For simplicity there are no units (e.g. 200 g of sugar is simply 200). 
// Ingredients that are not present can be considered as 0.

function cakes(recipe, available) {
  // Let's bake some cakes!
}

module.exports = cakes;
